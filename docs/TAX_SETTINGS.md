The Tax Settings feature allows administrators to configure VAT (Value Added Tax) and Service Tax for the application. Both taxes can be configured independently and support either percentage-based or fixed amount calculations.

- **Value Input**: Set the tax rate or fixed amount
- **Real-time Preview**: See how the tax affects a sample $100 order

### Service Tax Configuration
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle Service tax on or off
- **Type Selection**: Choose between percentage (%) or fixed amount ($)
- **Value Input**: Set the tax rate or fixed amount
- **Real-time Preview**: See how the tax affects a sample $100 order

### Combined Tax Preview
